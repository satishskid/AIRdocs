## üéì Adding New AI Models

### Academic Writing AI
To add a new academic writing AI tool:

1. **Update model discovery**
   ```python
   # In model_discovery.py
   def get_academic_writing_models(self):
       academic_models = [
           # Add your new model here
           {"name": "new-academic-tool", "provider": "provider-name", 
            "type": "academic_writing", "source": "academic"},
       ]
   ```

2. **Add to content categories**
   ```python
   # In app.py CONTENT_CATEGORY_CONFIGS
   "quality_models": {
       1: ["new-academic-tool", ...],
       2: ["new-academic-tool", ...],
       3: ["new-academic-tool", ...]
   }
   ```

3. **Test the integration**
   - Verify model appears in discovery
   - Test health checks
   - Test content generation

### Enterprise AI Models
For enterprise AI models:

1. **Add to enterprise models list**
2. **Implement API integration**
3. **Add authentication handling**
4. **Update admin dashboard**
