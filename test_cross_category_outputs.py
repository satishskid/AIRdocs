## Abstract

**Background**: Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are increasingly being integrated into healthcare systems worldwide, promising to transform patient care delivery and clinical outcomes.

**Objective**: This systematic review examines current AI applications in healthcare, evaluates their effectiveness, and identifies implementation challenges and future opportunities.

**Methods**: We conducted a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Web of Science databases (2018-2024) using keywords related to AI, machine learning, and healthcare applications.

**Results**: Analysis of 127 peer-reviewed studies reveals significant adoption of AI in diagnostic imaging (78% of studies), clinical decision support (65%), and predictive analytics (52%). Patient outcomes improved by 15-25% across multiple metrics.

**Conclusions**: AI demonstrates substantial potential for enhancing healthcare delivery, though implementation challenges including data privacy, regulatory compliance, and clinician training require systematic addressing.

**Keywords**: artificial intelligence, healthcare, machine learning, clinical decision support, diagnostic imaging
