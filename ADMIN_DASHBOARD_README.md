      "avg_response_time": 0.0,
      "credits_consumed": 15,
      "revenue_generated": 1.5
    }
  }
}
```

#### `/admin/models/performance`
Detailed model performance metrics with historical data and error logs.

#### `/admin/models/{model_name}/test`
Manual health testing for individual models.

### Frontend Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface using Claude.ai color palette

#### Interactive Elements
- **Model Testing**: Click-to-test functionality for each model
- **Real-time Charts**: Performance visualization using Chart.js
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded health status
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages and loading states

#### Performance Tracking
- **System Metrics**: CPU and memory usage charts
- **Model Analytics**: Success rates, response times, revenue tracking
- **Historical Data**: Trend analysis and performance history

## Data Tracking

### Model Performance Metrics
The system tracks comprehensive metrics for each AI model:

```python
model_performance = {
    'status': 'healthy|degraded|error',
    'total_requests': int,
    'successful_requests': int,
    'failed_requests': int,
    'average_response_time': float,
    'credits_consumed': int,
    'revenue_generated': float,
    'last_health_check': datetime,
    'error_log': deque(maxlen=100),
    'uptime_checks': deque(maxlen=24),
    'last_24h_requests': deque(maxlen=1440)
}
```

### System Metrics
Global system health and performance indicators:

```python
system_metrics = {
    'active_users': int,
    'total_documents_generated': int,
    'total_revenue': float,
    'system_uptime': float,
    'cpu_usage': list,
    'memory_usage': list
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### Accessing the Dashboard
1. Navigate to `/admin-dashboard.html` in your browser
2. The dashboard will automatically load system data
3. Data refreshes every 30 seconds automatically

### Testing Models
1. Click the "Test Health" button on any model card
2. View the test results in the popup dialog
3. Model status will update automatically after testing

### Monitoring System Health
- **Green Status**: System operating normally (>80% health)
- **Yellow Status**: System degraded (50-80% health)
- **Red Status**: System critical (<50% health)

### Understanding Metrics
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful API calls
- **Response Time**: Average time to process requests
- **Revenue**: Calculated based on credits consumed
- **Health Score**: Weighted average of all model health statuses

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH`: MD5 hash of admin password (currently: admin123)
- `API_BASE_URL`: Backend API endpoint (default: http://localhost:8001)

### Model Configuration
Models are automatically loaded from `/models/*.json` files with health monitoring enabled by default.

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Basic authentication system in place
- Admin endpoints protected (currently disabled for testing)
- No sensitive data exposure in frontend

### Production Recommendations
- Enable proper authentication for admin endpoints
- Implement role-based access control
- Add audit logging for admin actions
- Use HTTPS for all admin communications
- Implement session management

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Health Checks
- Automatic model health monitoring every 5 minutes
- System health calculation based on model availability
- Error tracking and logging for failed requests

### Performance Tracking
- Real-time request volume monitoring
- Response time tracking and alerting
- Revenue and usage analytics

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed usage patterns and trends
2. **Alert System**: Email/SMS notifications for system issues
3. **User Management**: Admin user roles and permissions
4. **Model Management**: Add/remove models through the dashboard
5. **Configuration Management**: Runtime configuration updates
6. **Backup and Recovery**: System backup and restore capabilities

### Technical Improvements
1. **Database Integration**: Persistent storage for metrics and logs
2. **API Rate Limiting**: Request throttling and quota management
3. **Caching Layer**: Redis integration for improved performance
4. **Load Balancing**: Multi-instance deployment support
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Prometheus/Grafana integration

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Dashboard not loading**: Check if backend server is running on port 8001
2. **No data showing**: Verify API endpoints are accessible
3. **Authentication errors**: Check admin password configuration
4. **Model status unknown**: Ensure model configuration files are valid

### Debug Information
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify network requests in browser developer tools
- Review backend logs for API errors
- Confirm model configuration files are properly formatted
